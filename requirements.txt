# The converter uses only the Python standard library (argparse, csv, json, tkinter, etc.).
# Tkinter ships with CPython on Windows/macOS. Linux users may need to install the
# system package (e.g., `sudo apt install python3-tk`) before running the GUI.
# Keep this file committed so any future third-party dependencies can be pinned here.
